    data-name: oha_metrics_by_lake.csv
    data-description: >-
      A csv file containing optical habitat (OH) metrics for xxx lakes in Minnesota. These metrics
      describe various features (slope, magnitude, location of peak, etc) of the relationship between water clarity and optical habitat in
      each lake. We calculated metrics for each lake-year, but report summary statistics across the 5 years (2010-2014). 
      
      Metrics related to the slope of the OH ~ water clarity curve at various clarities
      indicate how sensitive the lake is to changing clarity at various water clarity values.
      
      We generally calculated metrics in three different contexts. The first is the "optimal clarity" scenario, or the water clarity that
      produced the maximum OH. The second is "current clarity" which was estimated as the modeled water clarity value for 2018.
      The third context is clarity values that produce >5% of the total lake benthic area that is suitable walleye OH, which has been found to be
      a threshold of OH that can sustain a walleye population across lakes.
      
      Metrics related to the maximum annual OH indicate an individual lake's potential for OH given optimal water clarity.
      Metrics related to the current OH indicate the current amount of available optical habitat given modeled water clarity values for 2018.
      Metrics related to the distance to optimal clarity indicate the magnitude of water clarity changes that would be needed to achieve maximum OH.
      Metrics realted to "5PBOH" indicate the clarity values for that lake that would lead to at least 5% of
      the total benthic area that is suitable as Walleye OH. This 5% threshold has been shown to be conducive to a lake
      xxxsustaining a healthy walleye populationxxx. These metrics are useful in determining how resilient a lake is to maintaining good walleye habitat.
